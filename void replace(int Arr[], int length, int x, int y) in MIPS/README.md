Implement a procedure replace in MIPS assembly language that, given an
array of integers Arr, its length, integers x and y, replaces all x with y in Arr.
Then your program should print out all values of Arr.
For example, if Arr = {21, 20, 51, 83, 20, 20}, length = 6, x = 20, y = 5, then
after running your program the values of Arr should be Arr = {21, 5, 51,
83, 5, 5} and the values should be printed out. Your procedure must follow the
MIPS procedure call conventions.
The signature of this procedure in Java would look like this:
void replace(int Arr[], int length, int x, int y);
