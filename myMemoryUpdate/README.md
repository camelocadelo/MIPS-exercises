Write a function that updates an array of 1024 bytes (i.e., read, add one in the value of
every byte and write the modified values) using two parameters, int arrSize and int
stepSize. Use the MIPS conventions to pass the parameters.
The signature of this procedure in C would look like this:
void myMemoryUpdate (int arrSize, int stepSize);
