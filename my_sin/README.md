Write a function that computes the sine of a parameter x. Use the MIPS floating-point
register convention to pass the parameter x and to return the function result. All
computation should be done using double-precision floating-point instructions and
registers. Limit your computation to the first 10 terms of the series.
(assumption: pi = 3.142)
The signature of this procedure in C would look like this:
double my_sin (double x);
