Implement a procedure reverse in MIPS assembly language that, given a string S
and its length, reverses S.
Your program should prompt user to input a string S and print reversed S out. For
example, if S =“Hello”, then after calling your procedure S becomes “olleH”, and
this reversed S should be printed out. Your program should continue prompting
until the user inputs “-”, i.e., until S=“-”
Your procedure must follow the MIPS procedure call conventions. The signature of
this procedure in Java would look like this:
void reverse(String str, int length).
